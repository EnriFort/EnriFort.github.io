    <h3>"Online" Algorithms (Data Streams): Ideas and code</h3>

    <p>
        Sometimes the data could come in a <b>stream</b> form (i.e. instead of coming from a defined set, it is a never ending flow of information).
        So in this case what is you have got is an endessly growing database, where you are adding a row for each new observation.  
        The <b>Online algorithms</b> are a new kind of algorithms capable of updating values starting from a stream of data. This way we can update the current value
        using the last value obtained. In other terms, an online algorithm is one that can process the input step-by-step, in the order than the input is given to it, without having 
        the whole input available from the beginning.
    </p>

    <p> 
        For example, suppose we have a data stream \(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n\) coming from a trading stock. It is an example of endless flow of data. If we need to compute the 
        average price, we can't use the classical arithmetic average formula, but instead we need a way of updating the mean at each new \(n\)-th value \(x_n\).
    </p>

    In the case of the average the right formula is the following:
    \[ \bar{x}_{n+1} = \bar{x}_n + \frac{(x_i - \bar{x}_n)}{n} \] 
    where \(\frac{(x_i - \bar{x}_n)}{n}\) is the increment or decrement. The above formula is called <b>recurrence formula for the mean</b>.
