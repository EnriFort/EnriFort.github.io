    <h3>Stochastic processes and SDE's</h3>
    A <b>Stochastic process</b> (or random process) is defined as a sequence of indexed random variables, where the index is interpreted as time. Formally, it is defined on a shared 
    probability space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}) \), where \(\Omega\) is the sample space, \(F\) is a \(\sigma\)-algebra, and \(P\) is a probability measure. The random variables are 
    indexed by a set \(T\) and takes values in the same mathematical space \(S\). The latter must be measurable with respect to a \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\Sigma\). Therefore, given a probability space 
    \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}) \) and a measurable space \( (S, \Sigma) \), a stocastic process can be represented as:
    
    \[\{ X_t : t \in T \}\] 

    Traditionally, a point \(t\) from the set \(T\) has been interpreted as time, thus the R.V. \(X(t)\) represent a value observed at the time \(t\).

    <p>
        In stochastic processes, a crucial element is the <b>increment</b>, defined as the difference between two R.Vs of the same stochastic process. 
        For the previous index set of time, an increment refers to the change of the stochastic process over a certain interval of time.

        <b>Stochastic differential equation (SDE)</b><br>
        A <b>SDE</b> is a differential equation in which one or more component is a stochastic process. A <b>differential equation</b> is described in terms of deterministic increments, while in a SDE the increment is a random variable.
        The general form of a SDE is the following:
        \[dX_t = \mu(t,X_t) \, dt + \sigma(t,X_t) \, dB_t
        \]
        where \(X_t\) is the state of the system at time \(t\); \(\mu(t,X_t)\) is the deterministic part, which represent the drift;
        \(\sigma(t,X_t)\) is the stochastic part; \(dt\) is the differential of time, and \(B_t\) is a Wiener process (Brownian motion).

        A function, or a path, \(X\) is a solution to the SDE above if it satisfies:
        \[ X_T = \int_{0}^{T} \mu(t, X_t) \, dt + \int_{0}^{T} \sigma(t, X_t) \, dB_t \]
        where the stochastic process \(X_t\) is called <b>diffusion process</b>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        an important example of SDE is the arihmetic Brownian motion:
        \[dX_t = \mu dt + \sigma \, dB_t\]
        But there are also SDE where \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) not depend only by the present value of the process
        \(X_t\), but also by previous values of the process or others processes. In this case the solution, \(X\), is called an <b>It√¥ process</b> and is not a 
        markov process.
