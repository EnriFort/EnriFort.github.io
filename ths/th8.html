    <h3>Stochastic processes and SDE's</h3>
    A <b>Stochastic process</b> (or random process) is defined as a sequence of indexed random variables, where the index is interpreted as time. Formally, it is defined on a shared 
    probability space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}) \), where \(\Omega\) is the sample space, \(F\) is a \(\sigma\)-algebra, and \(P\) is a probability measure. The random variables are 
    indexed by a set \(T\) and takes values in the same mathematical space \(S\). The latter must be measurable with respect to a \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\Sigma\). Therefore, given a probability space 
    \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}) \) and a measurable space \(S, \Sigma\), a stocastic process can be represented as:
    
    \[\{ X(t) ; t \in T \}\] 

    Traditionally, a point \(t\) from the set \(T\) has been interpreted as time, thus the R.V. \(X(t)\) represent a value observed at the time \(t\).

    <p>
        In stochastic processes, a crucial element is the <b>increment</b>, defined as the difference between two R.Vs of the same stochastic process. 
        For the previous index set of time, an increment refers to the change of the stochastic process over a certain interval of time.

        <b>Stochastic differential equation (SDE)</b><br>
        A <b>SDE</b> is a differential equation in which one or more component is a stochastic process. A <b>differential equation</b> is described in terms of deterministic increments, while in a SDE the increment is a random variable.
        The general form of a SDE is the following:
        \[dX_t = \mu(t,X_t) \, dt + \sigma(t,X_t) \, dW_t
        \]
        where \(X_t\) is the state of the system at time \(t\); \(\mu(t,X_t)\) is the deterministic part, which represent the drift;
        \sigma(t,X_t) is the stochastic part, which involves a Brownian motion or other sources of randomness; \(dt\) is the differential of time, and 
        \(dW_t\) is a Wiener process.
