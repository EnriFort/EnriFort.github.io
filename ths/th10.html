    <h3>The Wiener process and the GBM</h3>
    The <b>Wiener process</b> is the real-valued continous-time most important stochastic process <a href="../ths/th8.html">[1]</a>, 
    which play a key role in different probability fields, particularly in the stochastic calculus and the theories of Levy processes.
    The wiener process is called also Brownian motion due its historical association as a model for
    Brownian movement in liquids.
    <p>
        
        Mathematically, given a probability space \( (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{P}) \), 
        a real-valued stochastic process \( \{W_t : t \geq 0\}\) is a standard Wiener process if it is characterised by the following
        properties:
        <ol>
            <li>
                \( \mathbb{P}(W_0 = 0) = 1\), i.e., the initial value of the process is zero with probability one (almost surely);
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The future increments \(W_t - W_s\) are independent of the past values \(W_u\), where
                \(0 \leq u \leq s\);
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The increment \(W_t - W_s\) is Gaussian, i.e., a normal variable with mean 0 and variance \(t - s\).
            </li>
            <br>
            Some definitions can also include an extra property, which states that this stochastic process is stationary:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>
                The increment \(W_t - W_s\) is equal in distribution to \(W_{t-s}\), for \(0 \leq u \leq s\).
            </li>
        </ol> 
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, by definition, the Wiener process has <b>stationary</b> and <b>independent increments</b>. The latters are normal random variables, which means that they
        can have both positive and negative real values. The previous two properties are called <i>distributional properties</i>. Another property is the <b>closure properties</b>, 
        meaning that if you apply some operations to it, you obtain another Wiener process.
        For example, suppose you have the Wiener process \( W = \{W_t : t \geq 0\}\), and you scale it for a certain costant 
        \(c \gt 0\), then \( \{W_{ct}/\sqrt{c} : t \geq 0\} \) is still a Wiener process.
        Regardin the sample pahts of this stochastic process, they are continous almost everywhere 
        (<i>almost everywhere</i> := the only region where the property does not hold is mathematically negligible).

    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
       An important derivation of the Wiener process is the <b>geometric Brownian motion (GMB)</b>, a continous-time stochastic process, where the logarithm of the variable subject
       to random fluctuations follows a Brownian motion with drift. More precisely, a stochastic process \(S_t\) follow a GMB if it satisfies the following SDE:
       \[dS_t = \mu S_t dt + \sigma S_t dW_t\]
       where \(W_t\) represent the Wiener process while \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) denote the drift and volatility, respectively.

    <h4>Simulation:</h4>
    <p>
        In the following graph a simple random walk simulate the Brownian motion, a mathematical model for random movements observed in various natural phenomena. 
        A particle starts at the center and takes random steps inboth horizontal and vertical directions.
